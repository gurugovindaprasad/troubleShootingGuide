{"instruction": "How do I resolve the 'Lid Opened' message on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Check if the lid is fully closed and the lid-magnet is aligned over the magnetic interlock switch. If not, align.\n2. Does the magnetic switch, or its wires, look damaged? If so, replace HH145883.\n3. Open the unit (with approval). Remove the left side panel to access electronics.\n4. Check if the magnetic switch cable is securely plugged into the controller PCB. If not, re-secure or replace HH145883.\n5. Remove the lid and freely align the lid-magnet with the switch. If it activates, re-align and tighten screws.\n6. If all else fails, the controller PCB may be bad."}
{"instruction": "How do I fix the 'Communication Failure' error on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Restart the unit and try again. If it works, the issue was likely temporary electrical noise.\n2. Charge the batteries and try again.\n3. If the issue persists, replace the controller PCB."}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve the 'Contact Hipotronics' message on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Verify oil cup electrodes are not touching and no direct short exists. Try again without the oil cup.\n2. Open the unit with approval. Remove the right side panel.\n3. Check HV transformer connections. If loose or touching chassis, reconnect properly.\n4. If connections are good, replace the HV transformer (likely internally shorted)."}
{"instruction": "What to do if the touchscreen is inoperable on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Open the unit with approval. Remove the left side panel.\n2. Check if the 4-pin ribbon touchscreen cable is fully seated on the LCD-PCB. Reconnect if needed.\n3. Check if the large ribbon cable between the controller PCB and LCD-PCB is fully seated. If not, reconnect properly.\n4. If everything is connected and the screen is still not working, replace the display."}
{"instruction": "How do I troubleshoot 'No Output Voltage' issue on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Check battery icon in the top-right display. If missing, power off, unplug, wait 30 mins, then retry. Battery may be too low.\n2. Open the unit with approval. Remove the left side panel.\n3. Check if all blue and brown wires are fully connected from controller PCB to overcurrent-PCB.\n4. Update microcontroller firmware via USB. Press 'Update PIC' and restart.\n5. During a test, check if voltage is output on blue/brown wires from controller PCB. If not, the PCB may be bad.\n6. Check if overcurrent-PCB/can-filter are sending voltage to the transformer. If not, replace HH601017 and/or HH17215.\n7. If transformer still not receiving voltage, check connections or replace transformer HHT0862D2."}
{"instruction": "How do I fix the OC60-DI if the unit won't boot or power on?", "input": "", "output": "1. Check if batteries are depleted and not plugged into mains. Plug in power cord and try charging.\n2. Open the unit with approval. Remove the left side panel.\n3. Check all cable connections: battery, power supply, LCD ribbon.\n4. Check if power supply is outputting voltage to the controller PCB. If not, replace power supply HH29327.\n5. Check if any LEDs are lit on the controller PCB. If not, the controller PCB is likely bad.\n6. If LEDs are lit, the LCD display may be faulty. Replace it."}
{"instruction": "What should I do if the batteries won't charge or are dead on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Plug in the power cord and try charging for at least 1 hour.\n2. Open the unit with approval. Remove the left side panel.\n3. Check all cable connections: battery and power supply cables.\n4. With power plugged in, check if red LEDs light up at the controller PCB's bottom. If not, replace the controller PCB.\n5. If red LEDs light up, but batteries donâ€™t charge, replace batteries HH145882 (x2)."}
{"instruction": "How do I fix temperature/humidity sensor issues on the OC60-DI?", "input": "", "output": "1. Restart the unit to re-initialize the sensor.\n2. Open the unit with approval. Remove the left side panel.\n3. Check all cable connections, especially the ethernet cable to the temp/humidity PCB.\n4. If that fails, replace HH601007 Temp/Humidity Sensor PCB.\n5. If still not working, replace the controller PCB."}
